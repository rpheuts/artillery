Artillery Shell
---------------

Artillery Shell was an early project (10-ish years ago). It started as an experiment and simple platform to help test early hacks for the Playstation Portable. After a first version received a lot of attention on PSP news websites development took off and Artillery Shell became one of the more famous early shells for the PSP.

Artillery-Shell was completely written by me, but incorporated graphical designs from others. After almost 10 years I happened to stumble across the source-code and decided to share it with the world. I'm committing everything as it was left by me as a 20-year old... 

Interesting fact: Artillery Shell was ported to Windows Mobile (for one of my early jobs) and shows how portable this code is. By replacing the drivers (which are the abstraction layer for the hardware) for drivers that talk to the Windows Mobile framework the whole shell was ported in a few days.
