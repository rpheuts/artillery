Artillery Shell
---------------

Artillery Shell was an early project (14-ish years ago). It started as an experiment and simple platform to help test early hacks for the Playstation Portable. After a first version received a lot of attention on PSP news websites development took off and Artillery Shell became one of the more famous early shells for the PSP.

Artillery-Shell was completely written by me, but incorporated graphical designs from others. After almost 15 years I happened to stumble across the source-code and decided to share it with the world. I'm committing everything as it was left by me as a 16-year old...
